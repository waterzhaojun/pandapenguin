This folder is the collection of functions used to analyse EEG data. Until now the EEG data is recorded by Spike2, and after organization we save it as csv file. The data passed between different functions should be a 2D matrix. The 1st dimension is the time course signal value. The 2nd dimension is the number of samples or trials.

For analysis, we need to do the following steps:
1. load data from csv files by function load_data. It need two input sourcetable and p. The variable sourcetable is a table or cell. Each row is a file path and the ref point I need to refer to load, for example 1000 means loading start from 1000th point. The variable p is the structure parameter. It should contain: the length of loading start from ref point. For example p=struct(); p.length=100000 means load 100000 points after ref point (include ref point), p.length=-100000 means load 100000 points before ref point (include ref point); scanrate, for example p.scanrate = 100 means 100hz. If we want to seperate the timecourse to multiple pieces, set p.piece_length = xxx.
